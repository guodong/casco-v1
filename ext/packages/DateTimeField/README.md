DateTimeField
=============

A DateTime Form Field UX for Sencha ExtJS 4.2.x, ExtJS 5.x and ExtJS 6.x

This widget displays a Time Picker panel by the Date Picker panel.

There is a DateTimeField.aux file already encapsulated and ready for use with Sencha Architect 3.x.

---

Usage: 

You only need to change the format value for the Time Picker to work. Having a format with "H" makes it 24/hour and "h" makes it 12/hour format.

Eg: 'm/d/Y H:i:s' or 'm/d/Y h:i A'

---

Known Bugs: 

- Min Value and Max Value does not prevent incorrect time selection
